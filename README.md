# Generative diffusion posterior sampling for informative likelihoods
This implementation is associated with the paper xxx. 
In the paper we develop a new approach for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models with sequential Monte Carlo methods.

# Installation
You install the package via a standard procedure:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zgbkdlm/gfk.git
cd gfk
pip install -e .
```

Depending on whether you need to run in a CPU/GPU, you may want to uninstall `jax`and `jaxlib` and then reinstall.

# Reproduce experiments
To exactly reproduce the numbers and figures in the paper, first run experiments:

```bash
cd experiments
python runs_gms/bash_aux.sh --dx=256 --nparticles=16384
python runs_gms/bash_aux_noiseless.sh --dx=256 --nparticles=16384
python runs_gms/bash_mcgdiff.sh --dx=256 --nparticles=16384
python runs_gms/bash_wu.sh --dx=256 --nparticles=16384
```

Then, run the scripts in `./summary` to produce the tables and figures, e.g.,

```bash
python ./summary/tabulate_gms.py
```

will produce the table.
